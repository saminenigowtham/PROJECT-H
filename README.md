#Hand Gesture Recognition using MediaPipe and OpenCV
Description:
This project demonstrates real-time hand gesture recognition using MediaPipe and OpenCV. It detects hand landmarks and interprets gestures based on their positions.

#Dependencies:

Python 3.x
OpenCV (pip install opencv-python)
MediaPipe (pip install mediapipe)
Setup:

#Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
#Install dependencies:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage:

Run the hand_gesture_recognition.py script:
Copy code
python hand_gesture_recognition.py
#Instructions:

Hold your hand in front of the camera.
Follow the on-screen instructions to perform gestures.
Press q to quit the application.
Example Gestures:

Open Hand Gesture: Detected when the palm is open and fingers are spread out.
Pointing Up Gesture: Detected when the index finger is extended upwards.
Notes:

This project is a basic implementation for educational purposes.
Further improvements can include adding more gestures and refining gesture detection logic.
